Generate a natural, informal, two-person text-message conversation in English, about any realistic, interesting topics people would actually chat about, 
with the conversation as long as you like. Output only the message texts themselves (no names, tags, timestamps, or extra formatting), 
in strict alternation between the two speakers, one short text-style message per line separated by \n, and feel free to use normal punctuation, 
casual phrases, emojis, and reactions. For example {conv_topics} You can use a conversation starter for exmaple {conv_starters}
