Your task is to create a text conversation chat log between two people. You can make the chat log as long as you like. The conversation should sound natural, 
as in it's a human conversation about things that two people are talking about over text. Each message of the conversation should appear on a new line, 
so you're separating messages with a new line character \n. There are many different topics you can talk about (plans, hobbies, relationships, work, school, 
family, jokes, etc.). It's completely up to you the topics that you want, but you should pick things that are interesting and are the kind of topics 
that people would talk about over text.
